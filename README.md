I'm just getting started with github, I don't have any goal in mind with this but to learn everything I can in programming and help everyone I can. For now i'm gonna 
try to beat all microsoft courses here and let's see what happens. I hope I get it, I mean I don't even know what pushes me to do this but I hope it'll worth it .
First day in github so let's see if I can get something big.
